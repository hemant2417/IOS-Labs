## Exercise - Failable Initializers

 Create a `Computer` struct with two properties, `ram` and `yearManufactured`, where both parameters are of type `Int`. Create a failable initializer that will only create an instance of `Computer` if `ram` is greater than 0, and if `yearManufactured` is greater than 1970, and less than 2020.
 */
struct Computer {
    let ram: Int
    let yearManufactured: Int
    
    init?(ram: Int, yearManufactured: Int) {
        guard ram > 0 else { return nil }
        guard (1970...2019).contains(yearManufactured) else { return nil }
        self.ram = ram
        self.yearManufactured = yearManufactured
    }
}

//:  Create two instances of `Computer?` using the failable initializer. One instance should use values that will have a value within the optional, and the other should result in `nil`. Use if-let syntax to unwrap each of the `Computer?` objects and print the `ram` and `yearManufactured` if the optional contains a value.
let computer1: Computer? = Computer(ram: 16, yearManufactured: 2019)
let computer2: Computer? = Computer(ram: 0, yearManufactured: 2019)

if let computer1 = computer1 {
    print("Ram: \(computer1.ram)")
    print("Year Manufactured: \(computer1.yearManufactured)")
}

if let computer2 = computer2 {
    print("Ram: \(computer2.ram)")
    print("Year Manufactured: \(computer2.yearManufactured)")
}

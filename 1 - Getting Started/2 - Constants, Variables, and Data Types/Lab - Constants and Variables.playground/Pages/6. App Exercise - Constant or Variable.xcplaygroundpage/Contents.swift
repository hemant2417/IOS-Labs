## App Exercise - Fitness Tracker: Constant or Variable?
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 
 There are all sorts of things that a fitness tracking app needs to keep track of in order to display the right information to the user. Similar to the last exercise, declare either a constant or a variable for each of the following items, and assign each a sensible value. Be sure to use proper naming conventions.
 
- Name: The user's name
- Age: The user's age
- Number of steps taken today: The number of steps that a user has taken today
- Goal number of steps: The user's goal for number of steps to take each day
- Average heart rate: The user's average heart rate over the last 24 hours

let Name: String = "Johny"
print ("we choose let bcz we dont need to change the name of the prsn")
var Age: Int = 35
print ("we choose var bcz we need to change the age of the prsn")
var NumberOfStepsTakenToday: Int = 10008
print ("we choose var bcz we need to change the number of steps taken today")
var GoalNumberOfSteps: Int = 10000
print ("we choose var bcz we need to change the goal number of steps")
var AverageHeartRate: Float = 76
print ("we choose var bcz we need to change the average heart rate")
/*:
 Now go back and add a line after each constant or variable declaration. On those lines, print a statement explaining why you chose to declare the piece of information as a constant or variable.
